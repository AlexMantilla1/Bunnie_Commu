Hello everyone!
This is the communication test with 1 master arduino and 3 arduinos slaves 
in different sda pins. The master goes through the different sda and asks 
for the addresses of the slaves. the slaves only hear the dirreciones and 
are associated with a single pin of sda. 


The test was done using 10 k pull up resistors.
